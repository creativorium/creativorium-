  title: Our <span class="mil-thin">Approach</span> <br>and <span class="mil-thin">Process</span>
  content: We build websites through collaboration between independent designers and developers, working closely from concept to launch. Rather than following rigid systems, our process adapts to the needs of each project — balancing visual design, technical structure, and real user behaviour to create sites that feel intuitive, fast, and purposeful.

    - label: "UX Audits"
      value: "
      <p>A UX audit helps identify how users interact with your website and where friction may exist. It focuses on structure, clarity, and usability rather than assumptions.</p>
      <p>Through independent analysis and shared discussion, we review navigation, layout, content flow, and responsiveness across devices to understand what works and what can be improved.</p>
      <p>The outcome is a set of practical insights that guide design and development decisions, helping improve user experience, engagement, and overall site effectiveness.</p>
      "

    - label: "Design Thinking"
      value: "
      <p>Design thinking allows us to explore problems collaboratively and from a human perspective. It encourages understanding user needs, testing ideas early, and refining solutions through feedback.</p>
      <p>Within our collective, this process supports open discussion, experimentation, and iteration — helping ideas evolve into web experiences that are both creative and functional.</p>
      "

    - label: "Wireframing"
      value: "
      <p>Wireframing defines the structure and flow of a website before visual design begins. It focuses on layout, hierarchy, and user interaction without visual distraction.</p>
      <p>This step helps align collaborators and clients early, ensuring functionality and content structure support the intended experience before development moves forward.</p>
      "

    - label: "Methodologies"
      value: "
      <p>Our methodology is flexible and shaped by collaboration. Each project evolves through shared planning, iterative building, and practical testing.</p>
      <p>By combining individual expertise with ongoing feedback, we create websites that are resilient, adaptable, and suited to real-world use rather than rigid templates.</p>
